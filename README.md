Source code for the paper titled "Combining GNNs and Sentence Encoders for Knowledge-aware Recommendations"

You will find the two datasets used in this work (movielens1m and dbbook), and also the scripts:
1. to learn graph embeddings
2. to learn word embeddings
3. to train the deep model and get the predictions.

In addition, we added the pre-trained embeddings used for this work (dict saved as .pickle files), so to skip the embedding learning step.
Source code is documented, so to make it easier to run it.
